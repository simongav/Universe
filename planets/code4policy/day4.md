## Scrummy Class

1. Scrum Meeting (class)
2. Scrum Meeting (groups)
3. Trello Board Review
	1. Review by a team or two of what has been working and what hasn't.
	2. Teams now have a few minutes to clean their trello boards, break down user stories into tasks (color code maybe?)
4. StoryTime (Pt2)
	1. Finish Creating User Stories
	2. Prioritize User Stories
	3. Select the 5 most important ones and
		1. make sure they meet INVEST
		2. have a clear definition of DONE on the trello card.
		3. These are stories you're most likely going to commit to for this sprint.
	4. Planning Poker
		1. Lets do one or two cards for a volunteer group with the whole class.
			1. Product owner presents a task
			2. There is a period of time in which people discuss what that means, ask clarifying questions.
			3. Poker commences
			4. Either agree on a consensus, or discuss further and do another round of poker.
		2. Now lets turn it over to the groups to do that with the rest of the tasks.
5. Sprint Planning
	1. Agree on user stories you will definately accomplish
		1. Product owner presents each story
		2. Team agrees to take it on or not
		3. If the team agrees, move all tasks associated with that story from product backlog to sprint backlog
	2. For our sake, lets move stories you don't plan to get to into their own list. `for-later`


Please note that these are abridged versions of the scrum meetings.
