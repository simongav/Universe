## Overview

Today we'll focus on the tools of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also have a short module on selecting a visualization for your project, a pair of guest speakers who will speak about agile and scrum in government and we'll get started with Sprint 2 of your project.

## Scrummy Class

1. Class standup scrum meeting
2. Project Group Scrum Meeting
3. Sprint Review Meeting
4. Sprint 1 Retrospective

## GitHub and GitHub Review

1. Demo of Git GUIs
2. Branching Review
3. Overview of Forking (all in GitHub)

## Selecting A Visualization

### Guest Speaker

Julia Wolfe, a Visual Journalist at FiveThirtyEight, will join us to discuss selecting a visualization.

### Some charts from my stories

1. You can use color to highlight what you want the reader to focus on [2nd chart](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-the-cable-news-networks-are-covering-the-russia-story-just-not-the-same-one/). An annotation might be a good small modification to elect to make to your d3 graphic of choice. Anotehr example might be [annotating an outlier](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-art-of-cherry-picking-polls/).
2. If there is something you have in mind, you might be able to google and find someone's example (you don't have to be limited to the examples I provided). For example, this is known as a [ternary plot](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-worst-tweeter-in-politics-isnt-trump/) and if you just google "ternary plot D3" you'll find some examples of plots just like it.
3. Hed and Dek [tell a story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-mayweather-mcgregor-fight-as-told-through-emojis/). Sometimes its a good idea to have a chart that can also stand alone.
4. Putting different subsets of the data side by side in two charts can help you [compare and contrast](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-media-really-has-neglected-puerto-rico/)
5. You don't have to visualize the whole dataset. One dataset can contain many stories. It might be easier to pick just one. [See Uber project](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/transportation/)
4. Label your axes (or at least mention the units of measurement in the text).
5. Cite your sources.

### Types of Data Stories

Some clips from [FiveThirtyEight](http://slides.com/dhrumilmehta/deck-dcee62b7-28ae-4199-8d47-4ceba73739aa-3#/1/2) if we have time.

## Tools for the Web

## Agile and Scrum in Government

1. Lets take some time to review agile and scrum discussion and write down a few questions.
2. Leah Bannon and Eric Mill from 18F will join us, and we'll have a short freeform discussion where you can ask some of your burning questions about agile in government.

## Project Scrum (Part 2)

### User Story Creation & StoryTime Meeting

1. **Collect User Stories** (15 minutes)

	Talk among your group and start capturing user stories for your project. This isn't just a hokey exerecise you have to do, so don't slack off or settle for bad user stories. This is really a conversation about what the final product will look like. Take each discrete story and put it on a notecard. Here is an example:

	> **As a** student applying for jobs
	>
	> **I want** a website that looks good
	>
	> **So that** I can use it in my portfolio

	Your group may or may not care about the look and feel of the site. You may say decide that you'll spend time doing original analysis, you'd prefer an ugly site with more code so that you can practice javascript.

	> **As a** activist
	>
	> **I want** a website that tells a clear story
	>
	> **So that** I can use it to convince people about my cause

	Or maybe your group has a lot of members working remotely.

	> **As a** group that is working remotely
	>
	> **I want** a site with one discrete page and dataset per group member
	>
	> **So that** it is less difficult to coordinate if we're all working on separate pages.

2. **Organize and Refine User Stories** (15 minutes)

	1. Take the most important ones and put them at the top of the stack, and the least important at the bottom. Combine any that are basically the same and split any that are too large.
	2. Select the 5 most important stories, and make sure they meet I-N-V-E-S-T and have a strong definition of done. Enter them into the top of a trello list called "USER STORIES".
	3. Normally story time and sprint planning are two separate meetings, but today we're running a hybrid. Create a new list in trello called SPRINT2 BACKLOG. Take each user story and break it down into tasks, put those tasks in the backlog, prioritizing the most important at the top.

3. **Planning Poker** (15 minutes)
	1. Product owner presents each task
	2. Product owner solicits questions to make sure everyone is on the same page about what is included in that task and what is not.
	3. We play a round of planning poker, and all agree on a value. Place that value on the trello card.

4. **Moving Forward** - Count up the total number of points for the sprint. Every day during your group's daily scrum, please move cards around on the trello board as they're getting done. It will be the job of one person on the team to maintain a "burndown" of how many points the whole scrum is worth, and how many points you have accomplished so far.  You will submit that as part of your final project.

	You should try to maintain a constant pace, or if you find you're not on track to finish, you may want to either adjust your pace or think about reducing the number of tasks, or negotiate a deadline extension.
