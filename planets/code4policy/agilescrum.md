## Writing Good User Stories

**As a _____**\<role\>**_____________**

**I want _____**\<feature\>**_________**

**So that _____**\<value\>**__________**

### User Stories ought to be

* **I**ndependant - stories can be worked on in any order
* **N**egotiable - A story is not a contract.  A story IS an invitation to a conversation.
* **V**aluable - If a story does not have discernable value it should not be done.
* **E**stimable - What happens if a story can’t be estimated?  You can split the story and perhaps gain more clarity. Or do more research to estimate it.
* **S**mall - Suggested 3-4 days of work max. For our class lets say 1 day of work MAX.
* **T**estable - How do you know when you're done?

#### Definition of Done

User stories ought to have a definition of done. Generally there is one generic definition of done that applies to every story in the project, but aslo specific **acceptance critera** for each story.

### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) Try It

Since we're running a scrummy class, and this class is our product. Lets write good user stories for the class! Lets do this one in pairs.

1. Brainstorm stakeholders
2. Write user stories
	* 2 as yourselves
	* 1 as other "users" (in our case stakeholders)
3. For each story, make sure you have a definiton of "done" as well as a checkbox for I-N-V-E-S-T. Be honest about which part of I-N-V-E-S-T it meeets and which part it does not meet.

Lets share and workshop them together. Present one and put the rest up on the board. I will look through them after class and see how they can inform the development of the course.


## Agile

### Agile is Cyclical

### Agile Manifesto

> **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
>
>**Working software** over comprehensive documentation
>
>**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
>
>**Responding to change** over following a plan

### Agile Principles

* Lets review the 12 agile principles from the "Elements of Scrum" recommended reading on https://read.amazon.com/
* Also found here: [https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/]( https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/)

### An Agile J-Term
Split up into 4 teams:

- 5 minutes of research on your topic
- 10 minutes of discussion about how that might apply to the course
- share that with the rest of the class

### Agile in Government
(Well, specifically the US Government)

Much of government traditionally operates in the waterfall style.

> Policy -->
> 
> Requirements Gathering/Design -->
> 
> Procurement/Contracts/etc -->
> 
> Development -->
> 
> Press release -->
> 
> Implementation

Some agencies are pushing for more agile development.

Its still nacent, but gaining momemtum. Like a baby holding onto the railing and learning to walk. -
