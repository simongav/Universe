1. Group stories
2. Prioritize (surface the most important ones)
3. Refine stories at the top of your stack
	2. combine the ones that are the same
	3. remove the ones that have no value
	4. split the ones that are too big
	5. make sure they meet I-N-V-E-S-T
	6. add definition of done
	7. add acceptance criteria / definitions of done
4. Planning Poker 

 	Estimate the size of each story with one of these values
 	`0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 40, 100, ? and ∞`
 	
 	Using the methodology described here:
 	
 	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker

### Planning poker activity

1. Make flash cards with these numbers on them

 	`0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 40, 100, ? and ∞`
 	
2. Lets calibrate. First the product owner (in this case me) will present each story and explain what it means. The group will ask questions to clarify what exactly the stort is. Then we'll have a round of poker.

	> **As a** group member, 
	> **I want** to select a topic to work on
	> **So that** we can get started on our project
	
	> **As a** scrum master
	> **I want** to plan our daily team scrum meeting time for this weekend
	> **So that** we are all on the same page about our progress every day and can plan our weekends accordingly.
	
	> **As a** product owner
	> **I want** to decide how many datasets we're going to take on
	> **So that** i know how collaboratively we will need to work this weekend.
	
	> **As a** student with a quantiative background
	> **I want** to analyze a dataset
	> **So that** i can use it next week in my project
	
	> **As a** student without a quantitative background
	> **I want** to find a preexisting dataset
	> **So that** i can use it next week in my project
	
	> **As a** person who has already found a dataset
	> **I want** to decide which visualization would best suit that dataset
	> **So that** i can think about how i might use it in my project

	> **As a** person who knows how to build a basic website with some text and images, but not how to do interactive visualizations
	> **I want** to build out a text only version of my website
	> **So that** I can have an MVP for the first sprint of this project.

### Planning poker and the project

This project will take place in two sprints. The first sprint starts today. Since the weather has changed up our plans, I will only require a round of planning poker for the second sprint starting next week. For this week just the tasks on a trello board will be sufficient. If you think playing planning poker will be helpful, please feel free to do it for sprint 1 as well.

### Setting up the Task Board

The product owner can please create a task board on trello. Make sure to have `A` or `B` in the title please, based on which section of the class your group is in.
