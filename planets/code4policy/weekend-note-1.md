# Weekend Note (Jan 6)

Hello everyone. Thanks for attending our joint session class on Friday and bearing with some of the changes to the schedule brought on by the weather. Here is a quick note to help you figure out how to best make use of your weekend. In my eyes, this is the most important order of things.

* Develop a comfort with using Git and GitHub, particularly working in branches.
* Work on Projects
* Other Homeworks (functions and jsforcats)
* OpenSource Readings

Please find some notes about the project below: 

## Project Notes
* Please mention in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mhHe1kaKyYTPdP8s4WjLGMRmQ-Z050Erk3cZKlGQFrE/edit#gid=595204673) who the product owner and scrum master is for your group. Please also make a slack channel for your group (and try to start the channel's name with the group number, for example `#A3-economics` would be a good name, to help me keep track of them). I'd recommend a public channel where you can invite @dhrumil or @ihsaan if you need help or want one of us to chime in, and can also invite the trello bot if you find it useful.
* Lets try to have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) up over the weekend. Remember: *working software over comprehensive documentation*. It doesn't have to be pretty, but words or bullet points on one or more simple html pages, with the pages linking to one another and some text might be a good start. Also just having practice working together as a team on GitHub and nailing down your workflow might prove more important than the product itself for the first sprint. You may want to practice making having team members create branches, do work in their branch, and issue pull requests for the product owner (or a particular team member) to merge that work into master.
* Please hold at least one (preferably two) scrum meeting. In person, Skype, or Slack are all okay - but remember, as agilistas we prefer face-to-face over text.

	> The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. -[Agile principle #6](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/). 
	
	It shouldn't take very long to run a quick scrum. Have some notes from your daily scrum meeting (maybe just a list of blockers, or something to show me that you did hold a meeting). 
* Try to use trello to break down the tasks, and move the tasks to 'doing' as you do them and 'done' as you finish or during standup meetings. Trello has great slack integrations too so when you move a card from one column to another it can keep all your teammates informed. If this doesn't work for your team, we'll keep in mind *individuals and interactions over process and tools*, and let it slide for Sprint 1 at least. For Sprint 2 next week, I will ask that you have real user stories and manage the project on a scrum task board.
* Please note I don't expect you to have a great sense of the visualization will look like. This first MVP can be text only. It would be good to have a sense of which dataset you plan to use at the end of this weekend and have some familiarity with that data, however we will also discuss creative ways to find data in class next week. Really what you should have by the end of this weekend is a shell of a project, an idea for some datasets, and enough of a sense of what the final projeect will look like to be able to write user stories for it.
* Please also remember that the projects will be due at the end of **Monday January 15**, you will likely want to plan time to work on the project on that final weekend after the last day of in-class instruction. I will remain in Cambridge Jan 13, 14, and likely 15 as well, and have office hours basically all day in Belfer-L2A during those days. I will be available on Slack and via video chat for those who are working remotely.
